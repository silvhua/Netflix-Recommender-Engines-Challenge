# Objective
The goals of this project were to:
1. Predict the rating a given customer would give to a movies they had not yet rated.
2. Recommend a customer a new movie that they would likely enjoy.

Experiment 1's objective was to experiment with different recommender engine methods to recommend one movie to a given user given the movie they just rated.

Experiment 2's objective was to estimate the ratings a user would give to movies. Select algorithms were then used to generate movie recommendations.

# Exploratory Data Analysis
Data were obtained from a [Kaggle challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/netflix-inc/netflix-prize-data
) using the same data as the Netflix Prize. 

The data consisted of:
* Movie ratings: customer ID number, rating from 1-5 (integer), movie ID number, and rating date.
* Movie information: movie ID and title.

Overall, a majority of ratings were from 3-5 (mean = 3.6, standard deviation = 1.1). The distribution of the ratings can be seen in the barcharts in the left panels of the `Experiment 2` figures below.

Due to computational limitations, most of the analyses were performed on only a subset of movie ratings.

# Experiment 1

To compare the quality of the recommended movies amongst the different recommender engine methods, recommendations were generated by each method for each of 100 random customer ratings (customer ID + rated movie). It is assumed that a good recommender engine would take into account the movies that the customer just rated such that if the 100 ratings were for several different movie titles, the recommendations would also include several different movie titles. Thus, the number of recommended movie titles from the resulting recommendations was then compared across the different methods.

Scikit Surprise models were trained on all available data. Most of the remaining recommender engine methods were based on data for the first 1 million ratings in the `combined_data_1.txt` file. However, due to computational limitations, some of the methods were based on fewer ratings.

# Experiment 2
## Methods
### Method I: `scikit Surprise`
Initially, using a train-test split using all ratings data (100,480,507 samples), the following three algorithms in the `scikit Surprise` package were compared:
* `SVD`
* `SVDpp`: This algorithm could not be executed with the data set due to computational limitations.
* `NMF`

### Method II: Classic Machine Learning

For all movies not yet rated by a customer, the rating was estimated according the following formula:

*rating = average of all given ratings + bias for the customer + bias for the movie*

* bias for the customer = average rating for the customer - average rating for all customer
    * Positive value indicates that the customer tends to give higher ratings than other users
* bias for the movie = average rating for the movie - average rating for all movies
    * Positive value indicates that the movie tends to be rated higher than other movies

This average-based rating estimation was then used as a feature in various classic machine learning regression and classification models. Because all ratings were integers, classification models were used to see if they would result in less error than regression models.

### Movie Recommendations

In terms of estimating ratings for a given user and movie:
* OLS regression (`LinearRegression`) performed the best of all models tested.
* The `SVD` algorithm performed best of the `Surprise` algorithms tested.
* The `NMF` algorithm performed the worst of all models.

However, when these models were used to recommend a new movie to a user based on top predicted rating, models that performed better in terms of traditional model evaluation metrics (R^2 score and RMSE) tended to have less diverse movie recommendations. In other words, the model that had the lowest predictione error recommended the same movie to most customers.

# Conclusions

In terms of estimating ratings for a given user and movie, an ordinary least squares regression model (with average-based rating estimation as features) performed the best (i.e. provided rating estimations with the lowest RMSE and highest R^2 score). However, user-to-user memory-based collaborative filtering provided the highest diversity in movie recommendations and may more accurately acccount for diversity in customer preferences.

# Challenges

It is unclear what would be the best method to evaluate the recommender systems: Models that performed the best in terms of traditional evaluation metrics tended to provide lower diversity in movie recommendations.

Other challenges included:
* Non-normal distribution of the target variable: there is a left skew in the ratings and most ratings were 3-4. As a result, the models tended to overestimate ratings when the true ratings were 1-2 and underestimate ratings when the true ratings were 5.
* Sparse utility matrix: Most users only rated 1 movie, which likely meant that many users and items were similar to each other when cosine similarity was used as a distance metric. 

# Lessons
* Always perform the exploratory data analysis.
* Look at the data in intermediate steps (e.g similarity matrix)

# Possible Next Steps
* See if a deep learning model would perform better.
* Experiment with multi-variate regressions with different feature engineering/feature selection.
